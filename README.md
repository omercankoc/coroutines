### What is Coroutines?
<p>A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously. On Android, coroutines help to manage long-running tasks that might otherwise block the main thread and cause your app to become unresponsive.</p>

<p>Coroutines is our recommended solution for asynchronous programming on Android. Noteworthy features include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lightweight</li>
  <li>Fewer memory leaks</li>
  <li>Built-in cancellation support</li>
  <li>Jetpack integration</li>
</ul>
